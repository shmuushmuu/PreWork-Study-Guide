# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## In the prework for a full stack bootcamp, we followed along a training tether that introduces the simplest meechanics of Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?



## Installation

N/A

## Usage

There are notes for the following topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. These are merely first impressions of a person's fist 20 hours coding. If we open the DevTools console (command+option+i on Mac / control-shift-i on Windows), we can see that JaveScript is running. DevTools will list what topics were learned in the prework, as well as choose a topic to study first.


## Credits

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
